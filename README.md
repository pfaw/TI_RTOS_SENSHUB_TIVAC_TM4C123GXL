# TI_RTOS_SENSHUB_TIVAC_TM4C123GXL_RTOS

- This project makes the TIVA C or TM4C123GXL interface and communicate the the Texas Instrument BOOSTXL-SENSHUB Sensor Hub  (or senshub)
- The final result is that of the example that is offered by TI in code composer studio for the TIVA C. However this project does so using TI-RTOS
- The project started from a code composer studio example. It had senshub working with the TM4C129g, uisng TI-RTOS.
  - I changed the pins used and changed the written API to what is used when using the TM4C123GXL MCU when using TI libraries as opposed      to when using the TM4C129g

- You can use this project as a jump off point if you're using the TIVA C, senshub, and are aiming to use TI-RTOS as middleware in your project
